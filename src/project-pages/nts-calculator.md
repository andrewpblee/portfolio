#AB Test Calculator<span>.</span>

This is a project I've been working on to speed up test reads for fellow analysts.

I created a simple html file that could be opened locally, with the calculations and logic in JS. Analysts can input data about the test itself, and the impact on the business at a channel total will be displayed.

Normally I would approach a project like this in python, but I wanted to create an attractive GUI that was easy to use, and couldn't easily be overwritten as could happen in excel. Previously we had encountered issues with different python versions being used across the team, and as the JS version didn't need any packages and could be run in all browsers, this felt like the easier option.
