#Pokemon Invasion<span>.</span>
This project originally came from a tutorial in _Python Crash Course_, which I've elaborated on to make a _Pokemon_ version.

This project is a great demonstration of object oriented python, as it relies on classes as the building blocks.

One of the main additions I've included is a "gotcha" icon, that appears when a pokemon invader is hit by a bullet. The aim is to have this appear on collision and then fade out over time.
